<h1>Hey!</h1>
<h3>Here's what i'm currently working on:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minecraft</li>
  <ul>
    <li>My Minecraft-Client - it's in a state between "active" and "inactive", sometimes i work on it, sometimes i dont work on it for weeks. Don't expect anything.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Here's what i have currently planned:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Zelda - Tears of the Kingdom</li>
  <ul>
    <li>A Music Mod. I didn't finish the game yet, so i'm currently still experiencing the base-game, so it may take a few weeks, or even months. I don't know when i'll work on it yet.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
